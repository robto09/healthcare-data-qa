# Healthcare Data QA Automation Testing Framework

This testing framework provides comprehensive test coverage for the Healthcare Data QA Automation system, including data quality validation, web UI testing, and API endpoint testing.

Author: Robert Torres

## Test Components

### 1. Data Quality Tests (`test_data_quality.py`)
- Data completeness validation
- Schema consistency checks
- Statistical validation
- Healthcare-specific validation rules
- Anomaly detection
- Correlation analysis

### 2. Web UI Tests (`test_web_ui.py`)
- Dashboard navigation testing
- Data visualization verification
- Quality metrics display testing
- Interactive feature validation
- Responsive layout testing
- Error handling validation

### 3. API Tests (`test_api.py`)
- Data ingestion endpoints
- Quality check triggers
- Validation result retrieval
- Model validation endpoints
- Error handling
- Large data processing

## Test Configuration

The `conftest.py` file provides common test fixtures and configuration:
- Test data generation
- Database setup
- API client configuration
- Selenium WebDriver setup
- File system management

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running All Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Running Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Run data quality tests
pytest tests/test_data_quality.py

# Run UI tests
pytest tests/test_web_ui.py

# Run API tests
pytest tests/test_api.py
```

### Running with Coverage
```bash
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## Test Data

The framework uses both synthetic and real healthcare data for testing:
- Sample insurance data for basic validation
- Generated test cases for edge cases
- Anonymized healthcare records for integration testing

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is integrated with CI/CD pipelines:
1. Automated test execution on pull requests
2. Coverage reporting
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Quality gate enforcement

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. Use descriptive test names that indicate the functionality being tested
2. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
3. Use appropriate fixtures for test setup
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Organization
1. Group related tests in test classes
2. Use fixtures for common setup
3. Maintain test data separately
4. Document test purposes and requirements

### Test Maintenance
1. Regular updates to test data
2. Periodic review of test coverage
3. Update tests when requirements change
4. Remove obsolete tests

## Reporting

Test results are available in multiple formats:
- JUnit XML reports
- HTML coverage reports
- Test execution logs
- Performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. WebDriver setup issues
   - Ensure Chrome/Firefox is installed
   - Update WebDriver version
   - Check system PATH

2. Database connection errors
   - Verify database is running
   - Check connection strings
   - Ensure proper permissions

3. API test failures
   - Confirm API server is running
   - Check endpoint URLs
   - Verify test data

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing test patterns
2. Add appropriate fixtures
3. Update documentation
4. Include test data if needed
5. Verify CI pipeline passes
