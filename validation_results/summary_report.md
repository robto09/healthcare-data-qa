# Healthcare Cost Prediction Model Validation Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the validation results for the healthcare cost prediction model using the Medical Cost Personal dataset.

## Model Performance Metrics
- **R² Score**: 0.86 (86% of variance explained)
- **RMSE**: $4,590.57 (Root Mean Square Error)
- **MAE**: $2,533.67 (Mean Absolute Error)

### Interpretation
The model shows strong predictive performance with an R² score of 0.86, indicating it explains 86% of the variance in healthcare costs. The average prediction error (RMSE) of $4,590.57 is reasonable given the wide range of healthcare costs in the dataset.

## Bias Analysis

### Age-based Disparities
- **Prediction Ratio**: 8.62
- **Prediction Difference**: $26,767.93
- **Status**: Requires Investigation
- **Recommendation**: Further analysis needed to understand age-based cost variations and potential bias

### Gender-based Disparities
- **Prediction Ratio**: 1.16
- **Prediction Difference**: $1,979.90
- **Status**: Within Acceptable Range
- **Recommendation**: Monitor for changes but no immediate action required

## Compliance Assessment
- **Overall Status**: Compliant
- **Key Findings**: While age-based disparities are significant, they may reflect genuine healthcare cost patterns rather than model bias
- **Actions Required**: 
  1. Investigate age-based cost predictions
  2. Document justification for age-related variations
  3. Implement regular monitoring of disparity metrics

## Recommendations
1. **Model Performance**:
   - Consider ensemble methods to potentially improve accuracy
   - Implement confidence intervals for predictions

2. **Bias Mitigation**:
   - Add age-stratified performance metrics
   - Develop specific validation rules for different age groups
   - Consider age-adjusted cost predictions

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up automated weekly validation checks
   - Implement alerts for significant changes in disparity metrics
   - Create dashboard for tracking key metrics over time

## Next Steps
1. Review age-based prediction patterns
2. Implement suggested monitoring systems
3. Document validation findings in model documentation
4. Schedule regular review of validation metrics
